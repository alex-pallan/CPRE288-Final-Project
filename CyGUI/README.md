# This is the GUI for our CPRE288 Final Project
## Spring 2024

Our GUI is based in React JS (meaning you use a modern web browser to access it, hosting it on your machine)

### To use this GUI:
1. Build a react app using `npx create-react-app cygui`
2. Import the code files into /src
3. Connect to the wireless network on the cyBOT
4. Run the python script to connecto to the cyBOT
5. Run the React App (`npm start`)
6. Navigate to it in a webrowser and connect it to the python script with a websocket by clicking "connect" in the top left corner of the GUI
