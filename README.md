# To work on this project:
1. Downlaod the `CprE288FinalProjectWorkspace` folder from this github
2. On a lab computer, launch Code Composer Studio
3. Select the folder you just downloaded as the workspace, and begin working
4. When you have finished your work, push the new folder to Github so the other team members can view the updated code

# To keep track of each other
1. At the top of this page you should see the `Projects` tab, click it
2. Click `CPRE288 Final Project`
3. You are greeted with a table with a variety of issues, create, move, and add comments to the issues as you work so we can stay organized

# Parts of this project
There are several parts of this project that can be broken up into more manageable chunks.
1. The Python/PuTTY GUI
2. The sending and reception of commands to the bot
3. The collection of data (Scanning)
4. Producing actions out of the bot (actually moving, potentially making sound)
Each person should work on their part of the project, so we can be prepared for demonstration.
